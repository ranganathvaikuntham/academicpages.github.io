Hello there !

You have landed on the personal page of Ranganath Vaikuntham.

I am a recent Masters graduate from Ecole Centrale de Lyon where I completed my education in Data Science and Applied Mathematics.

On this website you will find some of my blog posts and project work which I update from time to time.
