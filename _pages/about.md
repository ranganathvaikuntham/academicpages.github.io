Hello there !

You have landed on the personal page of Ranganath Vaikuntham.

I am a recent Masters graduate from Ecole Centrale de Lyon where I completed my education in Data Science and Applied Mathematics. My graduate program was focused on the learning the mathematics and programming involved in constructing robust data solutions .

On this website you will find some of my blog posts and project work which I update from time to time.

Most recently, from 2018 to 2019, I've worked at _ . This summer I'll be working as a Software Development Intern - Machine learning with  Advanced Innovations. Previously, I've had a chance to study at Mahindra Ecole Centrale and intern at __.

At my school Centrale Lyon, I have done research at the __ Public Health. I specialized in virtual and augmented reality, including building machine learning models for medical applications and streaming optimizations.I'm also a Graduate Teaching Assistant under Prof __ __ in the School of Computing and Information Sciences.

Outside of that, I like sharing code on GitHub, where you'll find both completed projects and works in progress. For example, I've worked on a multidisciplinary team designing a Indoor Positioning System called IPS. You can also find me at my LinkedIn posting updates every so often.
