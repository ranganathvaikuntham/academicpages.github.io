This is a simple blog post to quickly summarise the important basic GITHUB commands and concepts.
 

General Information:
======

Created in 2005 by Linus Torvals
GiT stores files of any kind. 
Decentralized or distributed version control system. Meaning many devs can work on a single project without need for them to be on the same network. Tracks every single change made on the project. Usually repo on local l machine then we push it to a remote repo (Bitbucket, Github).  No need oof Internet to work locally on pc but to push we need. 
Key concepts of GIT:
Keeps track of code history through snapshots of your files. Put in staging area with add command then it is pushed with commit. Can create branches too.

Basic commands:
======

$ git init  # Initialises GiT repository
$ git add <file> # Add fles to staging area
$ git status # display diffs between working tree and staging area
$ git commit # commit changes in index
Working with remote repos -
$ git push # push local repo to remote repo – need to add remote repo and creds – ssh keys are also option to login
$ git pull # pulls latest version from remote
$ git clone # will copy remote repo into current folder

Installing GIT:
======

Linux (Debian) – sudo apt-get install git
Windows – git scm site installer download – comes with git bash for more  linuxy env in windows
Recommended to use git CLI for learning under the hood concepts and working.
Git –version   #gives the current version of GIT

Practical working:
======

- If any changes are made to our repo and not staged and committed, they will be reported on the git status command.
Now .gitignore – files and folders we don’t want to include in our repo even if we do add .(add all).
File names directly added to gitignore file and  /directory format for folders.

Branches:
======

Help to create a separate copy to experiment and add new functionalities to existing software. For ex: adding login functionality.
git branch login # to create a login branch
git checkout login # to switch to this branch
git merge login # to merge login from master branch

Working with remote repos:

From local to remote:
------

git remote : lists the remote repos (currently at start we have none)
git remote ad origin - .git from repo
git push -u origin master

After adding a file and committing locally we can push to remote repo with git push .

Copying from remote to local:
------

git clone .git # copied from the repo
git pull # to copy recent updates

Note: Might need to setup init before cloning (yes if any parent is not initialized git repo)



Headings are cool
======

You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
